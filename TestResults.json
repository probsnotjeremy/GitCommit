          "question": "where are unwanted amino acids converted into urea",
          "expected_answer": "Deamination In the human body, deamination takes place primarily in the liver, however glutamate is also deaminated in the kidneys. In situations of excess protein intake, deamination is used to break down amino acids for energy. The amino group is removed from the amino acid and converted to ammonia. The rest of the amino acid is made up of mostly carbon and hydrogen, and is recycled or oxidized for energy. Ammonia is toxic to the human system, and enzymes convert it to urea or uric acid by addition of carbon dioxide molecules (which is not considered a deamination process) in the urea cycle, which also takes place in the liver. Urea and uric acid can safely diffuse into the blood and then be excreted in urine.",
          "llm_response": "Urine formation involves the conversion of excess or non-essential amino acids, which cannot be utilized by cells for protein synthesis, into a less toxic compound called uric acid. This process is primarily carried out in the liver and kidneys. Once formed, uric acid is transported to the kidneys through the bloodstream and filtered out as waste products during urine production. The resulting urine contains water, electrolytes (such as sodium and potassium), and other metabolic waste substances including urea from nitrogen metabolism.",

The first European explorer to sight New Zealand was Dutch navigator Abel Tasman on 13 December 1642.[1] The Dutch were also the first non-natives to explore and chart New Zealand's coastline. Captain James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages,[2] was the first European explorer to circumnavigate and map New Zealand. From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and various M\u0101ori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving M\u0101ori the same rights as British subjects. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the century and into the early part of the next century. War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from M\u0101ori to P\u0101keh\u0101 (European) ownership, and most M\u0101ori subsequently became impoverished.[3]",
