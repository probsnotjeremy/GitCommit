          "expected_answer": "Deamination In the human body, deamination takes place primarily in the liver, however glutamate is also deaminated in the kidneys. In situations of excess protein intake, deamination is used to break down amino acids for energy. The amino group is removed from the amino acid and converted to ammonia. The rest of the amino acid is made up of mostly carbon and hydrogen, and is recycled or oxidized for energy. Ammonia is toxic to the human system, and enzymes convert it to urea or uric acid by addition of carbon dioxide molecules (which is not considered a deamination process) in the urea cycle, which also takes place in the liver. Urea and uric acid can safely diffuse into the blood and then be excreted in urine.",
          "llm_response": "Urine formation involves the conversion of excess or non-essential amino acids, which cannot be utilized by cells for protein synthesis, into a less toxic compound called uric acid. This process is primarily carried out in the liver and kidneys. Once formed, uric acid is transported to the kidneys through the bloodstream and filtered out as waste products during urine production. The resulting urine contains water, electrolytes (such as sodium and potassium), and other metabolic waste substances including urea from nitrogen metabolism.",

From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and various M\u0101ori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving M\u0101ori the same rights as British subjects. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the century and into the early part of the next century. War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from M\u0101ori to P\u0101keh\u0101 (European) ownership, and most M\u0101ori subsequently became impoverished.[3]",

        "question": "why was star wars episode iv released first",
        "expected_answer": "Star Wars (film) Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A New Hope) is a 1977 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas. It is the first film in the original Star Wars trilogy and the beginning of the Star Wars franchise. Starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Peter Mayhew, the film's plot focuses on the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. This conflict disrupts the isolated life of farmhand Luke Skywalker (Hamill), who inadvertently acquires two droids that possess stolen architectural plans for the Death Star. When the Empire begins a destructive search for the missing droids, Skywalker accompanies Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Guinness) on a mission to return the plans to the Rebel Alliance and rescue Leia from her imprisonment by the Empire.",
        "llm_response": "Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope, also known as the original trilogy's fourth installment, premiered in 1977. The film has since become a beloved classic and is considered one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made. It tells the story of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia Organa, Han Solo, and other characters who are trying to save the galaxy from the evil Empire. Due to its immense popularity and critical acclaim, it became clear that this movie would be highly anticipated by fans around the world. As such, when the time came for subsequent episodes or installments in the series, they were often released after Episode IV-A rather than before. This allowed viewers to experience the entire storyline and character development before diving into new adventures with their favorite characters. Therefore, even though there may not have been any specific reason for Star Wars Episode IV-IIV to be released before the previous episode (Episode III), it simply followed the usual release schedule for films within the franchise.",

The political slogan Workers of the world, unite! is one of the most famous rallying cries from the Communist Manifesto (1848),[1][2][3][4][5] by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels (German: Proletarier aller L\u00c3\u00a4nder vereinigt Euch!, literally \"Proletarians of all countries, unite!\"[6] but soon popularized in English as \"Workers of the world, unite!

        "expected_answer": "1990s United States boom It was in the spring of 1994 that the U.S. economy finally reached \"escape velocity\": GDP growth surged and the number of jobs created (3.85 million) set a record that has yet to be surpassed as of 2015. But 1995 would bring a pause in economic growth, primarily because the Federal Reserve raised interest rates from 3% to 6% beginning in late-1994 to prevent inflation from rising after such rapid growth along with two government shutdowns that slowed the economy. The pause was short-lived, however, as the economy adjusted and the surge of investment in the Dot-Com bubble would jumpstart the economy beginning in late-1995. 1996 saw a return to steady growth, and in May 1997 unemployment fell below 5% for the first time since December 1973.",

        "expected_answer": "History of trial by jury in England In the 12th century, Henry II took a major step in developing the jury system. Henry set up a system to resolve land disputes using juries. A jury of twelve free men were assigned to arbitrate in these disputes. Unlike the modern jury, these men were charged with uncovering the facts of the case on their own rather than listening to arguments in court. Henry also introduced what is now known as the \"grand jury\", through his Grand Assize. Under the assize, a jury of free men was charged with reporting any crimes that they knew of in their hundred to a \"justice in eyre,\" a judge who moved between hundreds on a circuit. A criminal accused by this jury was given a trial by ordeal. Under the jury, the chances of being found guilty were much lower, as the king did not choose verdict (or punishment).",
        "llm_response": "The right to a fair trial, including trial by jury, is protected in many countries and has its roots in English common law. It was established through legal precedents such as the Magna Carta (1215) and later codified into statutes.",

        "expected_answer": "Knights of Labor In 1869, Uriah Smith Stephens, James L. Wright, and a small group of Philadelphia tailors founded a secret organization known as the Noble Order of the Knights of Labor. The collapse of the National Labor Union in 1873 left a vacuum for workers looking for organization. The Knights became better organized with a national vision when they replaced Stephens with Terence V. Powderly. The body became popular with Pennsylvania coal miners during the economic depression of the mid-1870s, then it grew rapidly.[4] The KOL was a diverse industrial union open to all workers. The leaders felt that it was best to have a versatile population in order to get points of view from all aspects. The Knights of Labor barred membership from five groups: bankers, land speculators, lawyers, liquor dealers and gamblers.[5] Its members included low skilled workers, railroad workers, immigrants, and steel workers.[6]",
        "llm_response": "The Knights of Labor represented a wide range of skilled and unskilled laborers, including factory workers, miners, railroad workers, agricultural workers, domestic servants, and other blue-collar workers.

The name was interpreted as a Native American reference in the 1960s, and the university did have a mascot (adorned in Native American dress), which eventually led to the team's name change to the Red Storm. The change happened at a time when there was mounting pressure on colleges and universities to adopt names more sensitive to Native American culture.[6][7] The Redmen name still remains popular among fans, however, as does \"Johnnies\".
