First, he examines the stairs and notices that they are made of very hard marble. He then goes to the tree, which brings back memories of Gene's time as a student at Devon. From this point, the novel follows Gene's description of the time span from the summer of 1942 to the summer of 1943.

There are two ways of expressing the against dealer hand house advantage. If the house advantage is expressed as a percentage of the Ante wager only (at 3.37%) this could encourage players to erroneously think that the house advantage on the Play wager is 0.00%, and so think that the Play wager should always be made. Consequently it is better for players to understand the concept of house advantage on the total combined wager in the against dealer mode, being 2.01%.",

        "expected_answer": "Epidermis The stratified squamous epithelium is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale. Differentiating cell delaminate from the basement membrane and are displaced outwards through the epidermal layers, undergoing multiple stages of differentiation until, in the stratum corneum, losing their nucleus and fusing to squamous sheets, which are eventually shed from the surface (desquamation). Differentiated keratinocytes secrete keratin proteins which contribute to the formation of an extracellular matrix and is an integral part of the skin barrier function. In normal skin, the rate of keratinocyte production equals the rate of loss,[4] taking about two weeks for a cell to journey from the stratum basale to the top of the stratum granulosum, and an additional four weeks to cross the stratum corneum.[2] The entire epidermis is replaced by new cell growth over a period of about 48 days.[11]",
        "llm_response": "The basal layer of the epidermis, also known as the stratum basale or stem cells layer, is responsible for cell division. It continuously produces new skin cells that are pushed upwards towards the surface to replace older, dead cells in the upper layers of the epidermis. This process ensures a constant turnover of skin tissue and helps maintain its integrity and function. Additionally, the basal layer contains melanocytes, specialized cells that produce melanin, giving color to our skin. Melanocytes can be found within this layer and contribute to protecting the underlying tissues from harmful UV radiation by producing pigments like eumelanin (brown/black) and pheomelanin (red/yellow). Overall, the basal layer plays a crucial role in both cellular proliferation and pigment production in the epidermal region.",

As it is a fermion, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle.[9] Like all elementary particles, electrons exhibit properties of both particles and waves: they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light.

Pigeon holes were the openings set in a wall or a purpose-built pigeon cote in which the birds nested. By 1789, the arrangement of compartments in writing cabinets and offices used to sort and file documents had come to be known as pigeon holes because of their resemblance to the pigeon cote. By the mid 19th century, pigeon hole was being used as a verb meaning either to put a matter to one side with the intention of coming back to it later, or to classify information.[1]",
        "llm_response": "The phrase \"pigeon hole\" is believed to have originated in England during the 18th century. It was first used by Samuel Johnson, an English lexicographer and writer who defined it as a small wooden box or container for birds like pigeons. Over time, the term came to be associated with conforming to preconceived ideas or expectations, just like how a bird might get stuck inside a narrow opening of a pigeonhole. This figurative expression implies that individuals may feel confined or limited when they are expected to fit into certain roles or categories without room for individuality or uniqueness.",

Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) produced in the zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs.[4] The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes that take place in cortical cells.[5] The medulla produces the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations.[4]",

The first was Jawaharlal Nehru of the Indian National Congress party,[2] who was sworn-in on 15 August 1947, when India gained independence from the British. Serving until his death in May 1964, Nehru remains India's longest-serving prime minister. He was succeeded by fellow Congressman Lal Bahadur Shastri, whose 19-month term also ended in death. Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, succeeded Shastri in 1966 to become the country's first woman premier. Eleven years later, she was voted out of power in favour of the Janata Party, whose leader Morarji Desai became the first non-Congress prime minister. After he resigned in 1979, his former deputy Charan Singh briefly held office until Indira Gandhi was voted back six months later. Indira Gandhi's second stint as Prime Minister ended five years later on the morning of 31 October 1984, when she was gunned down by her own bodyguards. That evening, her son Rajiv Gandhi was sworn-in as India's youngest premier, and the third from his family.

The animal is the sole living representative of its family (Ornithorhynchidae) and genus (Ornithorhynchus), though a number of related species appear in the fossil record.

        "question": "when is mating season for great horned owls",
        "expected_answer": "Great horned owl Great horned owls are some of the earliest-breeding birds in North America, seemingly in part because of the lengthy nightfall at this time of year and additionally the competitive advantage it gives the owl over other raptors. In most of North America, courtship is from October to December and mates are chosen by December to January.[6] This species is strictly monogamous. During courtship in late fall or early winter, the male attracts the attention of his mate by hooting emphatically while leaning over (with the tail folded or cocked) and puffing up his white throat to look like a ball.[6] The white throat may serve as a visual stimuli in the low light conditions typical of when this owl courts.[29] He often flies up and down on a perch, while approaching the potential mate. Eventually, he comes to approach the female and tries to rub his bill against hers while repeatedly bowing. If receptive, the female hoots back when the pair meet but is more subdued in both her hoot and display. The male may convince the female by bringing her freshly caught prey, which they will share.[5][6] While males often hoot emphatically for about a month or six weeks towards the end of the year, the period where females also hoot is usually only a week to ten days.[28] Pairs typically breed together year after year and may mate for life, although they associate with each other more loosely when their young become mostly independent.[6] Pairs rekindling their reproductive relationship in the winter may perform a milder courtship to strengthen pair bonds before producing young.[28]",
        "llm_response": "Mating season for Great Horned Owls typically occurs during the spring, with some variation depending on geographic location. The breeding period usually lasts from February to May in North America and can extend into June or July in more southern regions. During this time, male owls will perform elaborate courtship displays to attract females.",
